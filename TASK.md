For a conspiracy board application, you'll need several technologies to handle the interactive elements, real-time collaboration, and visual connections. Here's what I'd recommend:
- Frontend:
React or Next.js for UI development
Canvas API or libraries like react-konva for the drawing connections
react-dnd for drag and drop functionality
TailwindCSS for styling
- Backend:
Node.js with Express or Next.js API routes
Socket.io for real-time collaboration
MongoDB or PostgreSQL for database
- Authentication:
NextAuth.js or Firebase Auth
- Image Handling:
Cloudinary or AWS S3 for image storage
sharp for image processing
- Deployment:
Vercel for frontend hosting
Railway, Fly.io, or Render for backend services
- Real-time Collaboration:
Yjs or ShareDB for conflict-free data synchronization
Socket.io for real-time updates
This stack would provide a solid foundation for building an interactive conspiracy board with all the features you described.
